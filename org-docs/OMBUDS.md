# Ombudspersons

Ombudspersons can help, whether itâ€™s listening, directing you to the appropriate community members, identifying your options, or coaching you to prepare for a difficult conversation.
They are ready to receive any reports of instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior by member(s) of this community, inform you about the appropriate course of action and take agreed measures to ensure such instances are amended and effectively averted in the future.

The NiPreps Ombudspersons abide by the [Code of Ethics](https://ombuds.utexas.edu/sites/default/files/documents/IOA_Code_of_Ethics_English.pdf) of the International Ombudsman Association (IOA).

Ombuds consultations are confidential, only in the case of imminent risk or serious harm may your identity be disclosed or your concerns discussed with anyone without your explicit permission.
