# Ombuds team

Ombuds serve voluntarily for as long as they are willing to sustain their commitment (see eligibility requirements below). Ombudspersons of the NiPreps Community have two primary responsibilities:

  1. to serve as a point of contact to receive reports and listen to individuals and groups involved in the NiPreps Community to assist them in determining the options to resolve conflicts, miscommunication issues, violations of the Code of Conduct, or any unacceptable behavior by member(s) of this community.
  1. to bring systemic concerns to the attention of the NiPreps Steering Committee for resolution.

The NiPreps Ombuds team is guided by the [Code of Ethics](https://www.ombudsassociation.org/assets/IOA%20Code%20of%20Ethics.pdf) of the International Ombudsman Association (IOA).

Ombuds consultations are confidential; only in the case of imminent risk or serious harm may your identity be disclosed or your concerns discussed with anyone without your explicit permission.

## Requirements for Ombuds

Effective ombuds are active listeners, able to communicate successfully, and remain nonjudgmental, especially at the initial stages of a report when an individual has taken the courageous step of speaking out.
At subsequent stages, ombuds demonstrate their problem-solving and conflict-resolution skills, driven to understand all positions deeply.
Although specific training is recognized and encouraged, the *NiPreps Community* needs more resources to provide formal training, and therefore, specific training is optional to serve as Ombuds.

It is also fundamental for ombuds to be neutral. The most obvious proof of neutrality is that ombuds are not simultaneously involved in any capacity within the *NiPreps Community*. As ombuds, they do not participate in the decision-making or provide advisory services to the different organisms and committees of the institution. Formerly active members who are now inactive are welcome to become Ombuds.
